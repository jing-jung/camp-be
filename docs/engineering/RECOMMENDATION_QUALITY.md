# Recommendation Quality Criteria

This guide defines the minimum quality bar for a StockBrief recommendation
candidate. It is an operating checklist, not a trading signal.

Recommendation means `검토 후보 추천`. A candidate can help a user decide what to
review next, but it must not tell the user to buy, sell, enter a position, set a
target price, or expect a guaranteed result.

## Quality Bar

A deployed candidate flow is healthy when all checks pass:

| Area | Required Signal | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate list | `/v1/stocks/candidates` returns at least one item. | The FE home and explore views have data to render. |
| Evidence count | Each listed item has at least two public evidence records. | A candidate should not be shown from a single weak signal. |
| Freshness | Candidate list items include `evidence_summary.latest_at`; detail includes `data_freshness.as_of`. | Users need to know the data basis. |
| Detail contract | `/v1/stocks/candidates/{ticker}` includes `evidence_level`, `evidence_count`, `missing_data`, `risk_tags`, and `recommendation_reasons`. | FE detail and AI explanation need the same source of truth. |
| Risk context | Detail has at least one risk tag. | A candidate without risk context is incomplete. |
| Evidence source | `/v1/stocks/{ticker}/evidence` returns public evidence with source type, source name, URL, and published timestamp. | Users must be able to inspect the basis. |

If provider egress is paused for cost control, the quality smoke can still pass
using the latest stored evidence. Live ingestion reactivation is a separate
operation and requires the ingestion runbook gates.

## Smoke Command

Run this after FE-BE connection changes, ingestion evidence changes, or before
resuming product-flow work:

```bash
STOCKBRIEF_API_BASE_URL="https://hazfha7995.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com" \
  uv run python scripts/check_recommendation_quality_smoke.py --ticker 005930
```

The script calls:

- `GET /v1/stocks/candidates`
- `GET /v1/stocks/candidates/{ticker}`
- `GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/evidence`

The output is redacted by design. It reports counts, basis dates, source type
coverage, and structured blocker codes. It does not print raw provider bodies,
full news text, user tokens, or private account data.

## Interpreting Failures

| Blocker | Meaning | First Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate_list_empty` | No candidates are available. | Check seed/live score rows and candidate eligibility. |
| `candidate_evidence_below_minimum` | A list item has fewer than two evidence records. | Check ingestion status and evidence joins. |
| `missing_candidate_latest_at` | Candidate summary has no latest evidence timestamp. | Check `evidence_summary` aggregation. |
| `detail_evidence_below_minimum` | Detail has too little evidence. | Check `recommendation_scores.evidence_count`. |
| `missing_risk_tags` | Detail has no risk context. | Check `risk_signals` for the ticker. |
| `missing_data_not_array` | Detail contract no longer returns `missing_data` as an array. | Check API response model and serializer. |
| `missing_data_freshness_as_of` | Detail has no basis date. | Check score freshness fields. |
| `missing_recommendation_reasons` | Detail cannot explain why the candidate appears. | Check reason generation and evidence linkage. |
| `evidence_items_below_minimum` | Evidence tab has too few records. | Check `/v1/stocks/{ticker}/evidence`. |
| `evidence_item_not_object` | Evidence response contains a malformed item. | Check API response serialization. |
| `evidence_item_missing_source_metadata` | A specific evidence item lacks `source_type`, `source_name`, `url`, or `published_at`. | Check source document normalization and provider date parsing. |
